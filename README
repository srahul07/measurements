# Length Converter - Basic

A library to convert length from one unit to another.

In this branch, it assumes only following three length units:

1. Meter (m)
2. Inches (in)
3. Yard (yd)

`NOTE:` This branch does not consider extending the functionality for other length units. The initial purpose is to implement functionality only for converting between above 3 units.

Example 1:
```python
>>> from lengths.converter import Converter
>>> converter = Converter.convert_to_length(3.6, "yard", "inches")
>>> converter
'129.6 inches'
>>> 
```

Example 2:
```python
>>> from lengths.converter import Converter
>>> converter = Converter.convert_to_all(3.6, "yard")
>>> converter
['0.100008 in', '3.29184 m', '3.6 yd']
>>> 
```

Example 3:
```python
>>> from lengths.converter import Converter
>>> converter = Converter.convert(3.6, "yard", "metres")
>>> converter
{'source_value': 3.6, 'source_unit': 'yard', 'target_value': 3.29184, 'target_unit': 'metres'}
>>> 
```

## `Warning:`

Measurements are stored internally by converting them to a floating-point number. 
Given that floating-point numbers are very slightly lossy, you should be aware of any inaccuracies that this might cause.
